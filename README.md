ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Sicilia - a Healthcare Integration Developer by day, bug hunter by night! 

ðŸ”¬ Former microbiologist who caught the coding bug (pun intended!) and made the exciting leap into tech. Currently wearing multiple hats as an Integration Developer at KPMG while finishing up my PhD in Infectious Diseases (because why not do both? ðŸ˜…).

ðŸŒ± She Codes Australia alumna, passionate about breaking down barriers in tech. Currently tinkering with full-stack development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django, React) and diving deep into healthcare integration.

ðŸ”­ When I'm not coding or science-ing, you'll find me:
- Mentoring future STEM superstars
- Volunteering with WiTWA (Women in Technology WA)
- Leading communications for KPMG's Belong network
- Writing about nasty bugs (the bacterial kind!) ðŸ¦ 

ðŸ’¡ Fun fact: I speak 5 languages and can explain complex medical terms in all of them (though I prefer explaining in code these days!)

ðŸŽ¯ Mission: Using tech to make healthcare more accessible and connected. Because what's better than combining medical science knowledge with coding superpowers? 

Let's connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€
